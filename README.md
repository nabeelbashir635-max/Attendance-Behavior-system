# Attendance-Behavior-Detention

Small, client-side demo app to record students, attendance, behavior, and detentions.

Notable features:
- Add students and optional photos
- Log attendance and behavior
- Inline edit for students and behavior entries (added)
- CSV and PDF exports

This is a simple demo that stores data in browser localStorage. For production use, replace with a proper backend.
